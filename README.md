# ALC-With-GoogeV3.0
Working in partnership with Udacity and Andela, in July 2017, Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, announced a pledge to provide digital skills training to ten million people in Africa, and also to provide mobile developer training to 100,000 Africans. Google (https://africa.googleblog.com/2018/03/announcing-2018-google-africa.html) offering 15,000 2-month ‘single course’ scholarships and 500 6-month nanodegree scholarships to aspiring and professional developers across Africa. The training will be available online via the Udacity training website, and the Andela Learning Community will support the students (in Nigeria and Kenya) through mentorship, in-person meet-ups, and online communities.

The Andela Learning Community (https://community.andela.com/c/welcome) combines Andela’s learning science with Udacity’s online curriculum and Google’s developer scholarships to provide the platform you need to become a world-class problem solver (https://andela.com/alc/in-progress/google-africa-developer-scholarship-2021/)

This program aims to engage with existing and aspiring developers to help them build the skills they need to get a job in tech after the program is over. The Google Africa Developer Scholarship (GADS) program gives participants free access to select courses, projects, embedded labs (powered by Qwiklabs) and skill assessments; plus support from the Google Developer community. The resources available in this program will help developers build the skills necessary to get their Google certification. Previous participants have gone on to build impactful projects for their communities, make incredible steps in their career journeys, and even become Google-certified developers and engineers.

I registered for ALC 3.0 and was accepted into the Front-End Developer Beginner track.
